django-sharer
=============

This is a simple Django application that provides an interface to share a
given item on social networking sites, or send an email to a friend about it.


Dependencies
------------

django-sharer requires Django 1.0 or later. To enable the JavaScript widget,
jQuery 1.2 or later with the jQuery Class plug-in 
<http://github.com/taylanpince/jquery-class> is needed. A combined version of 
these tools is available within the distribution, but if you already are using
jQuery in your project, you might want to grab the Class plug-in separately
and include it in your template.


Installation
------------

To install the app, make sure you place it somewhere on your PYTHONPATH and
include it in your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django-sharer',
        ...
    )

You may also want to include the share_uri context processor in your
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS:

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        ...
        'sharer.context_processors.share_uri',
    )

This is not required, but makes it possible for the app to generate a widget
without any parameters.

If you are going to use the share by email feature, you should also update
your urls.py to include sharer urls:

    (r'^share/', include('sharer.urls')),

In your MEDIA_ROOT folder, make a symlink named sharer to the django-sharer's
media directory:

    cd my_project/media
    ln -s path/to/django-sharer/sharer/media sharer

Finally, to use the widget in your templates, load the template tag library,
include the necessary JS and CSS files, and then call the template tag:

    {% load sharer_tags %}
    
    {% block javascript %}
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}sharer/js/sharer.js"></script>
    {% endblock %}

    {% block css %}
    <style type="text/css">
        @import "{{ MEDIA_URL }}sharer/css/sharer.css";
    </style>
    {% endblock %}
    
    {% block content %}
    
    {% share %}
    
    {% endblock %}

You can also call the share template tag with a specific title and/or URL:

    {% share title url %}


Customization
-------------

If you would like to send out email messages that contain HTML instead of 
plain text, you can do so by explicitly calling the email views with some
extra parameters. In your urls.py, instead of including sharer urls, do this:

    url(r'^share/$', 'sharer.views.share', {
        "mimetype": "html",
        "subject_template": "sharer/subject.txt",
        "body_template": "sharer/body.html",
    }, name='sharer_share'),
    
    url(r'^share/done/$', 'sharer.views.share_done', name='sharer_done'),

You can also turn off sharing by email completely by overriding the default
setting variable. In your settings.py, do this:

    SHARER_ENABLE_EMAILS = False

If you set this to False, you don't have to include the urls.


Features to be Implemented
--------------------------

- Email sender should be secured against possible spammer attacks. Possible
  solutions:

    * CAPTCHA
    * Check HTTP_REFERRER

- AJAX requests should show a loading bar

- More social networks should be added in the initial_data

- Add tests (!)
